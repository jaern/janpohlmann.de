        <h3 id="about">About</h3>	
        <p>In my years of consulting across a wide range of products, clients, industries and countries, my passion for the perfect user experience has only grown. I am always enthusiastic about tailoring the product to the needs of the users and enjoy championing their cause against any opposition. A master's degree in HCI gives me the theoretical foundation to apply the whole UX toolbox correctly and to maximum effect.</p>
        <p>At the same time, with a background in Information Systems and coding experience, I am also able to understand the other perspectives. I strongly believe that a great user experience is only possible when all stakeholders work together closely. My business mindset and technical skills, in addition to my UX experience, allow me to speak everyone's language to forge a unified vision of the product.</p>
